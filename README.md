Corrected following issue:~~* Known issue: Due to the logic for the newest version of "user_input", the scaling ability of terminal window has become broken. The next update will resolve this issue.~~

### Shell out

Note: You perform this by keying in "$", this will prompt the script to allow you to type as if you're on the CLI. (Good for one off commands)
